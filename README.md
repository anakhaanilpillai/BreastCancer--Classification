# BreastCancer--Classification
"This repository contains an implementation of supervised learning techniques for classifying breast cancer using the sklearn dataset. It includes preprocessing, application of five classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN), and a comparison of their performance."
Breast Cancer Classification Using Supervised Learning

Overview

This project focuses on applying supervised machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign using the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, implementation of various classification algorithms, and a comparison of their performance.
